### Case Study Overview
---

This case study expected data analysts to support an angel investment firm by discovering top 3 performing industries in terms of **the highest number of unicorn companies that they have had within their scope up to now**. In the world of finance, “*the term unicorn refers to a privately held startup company with a value of over $1 billion*.”

As well as discovering what those top industries are, an exploration work of average valuation in billions and number of unicorns for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 per the top 3 was undertaken, in order to identify trends towards where high-growth companies mostly stem from.


### Data Source

The database named after *Unicorns* utilised for this project is hosted at DataCamp's servers, and such, no data import work was necessary to undertake. The database consists of the following four tables:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA predominantly involved exploring the Unicorns database to answer key questions, such as:

1. XXX




### Data Analysis


```sql
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE cond = 2
```

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarised as follows:



### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.


### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a
few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlatation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
